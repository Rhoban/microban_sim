"""Run a controller, the same file as on the real robot (microban: ``make run CONTROLLER=my_controller.py``).

A controller is a class with ``step(obs) -> targets`` (the 19 joint targets, rad, order ``JOINTS``; None keeps the
last ones), called every 20 ms with ``sim.observation()``, and optionally ``reset(obs)`` (called when it starts) and
``kp_fw`` (the servos' gain while it runs; 125 by default, as the robot runs learned policies).
